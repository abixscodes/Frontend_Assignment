# My Frontend Assignment

## Overview

This project is a React-based user interface created using Next.js. The UI resembles a table structure where each row represents a state, with columns for product filters and design variants. The functionalities include adding/deleting states, adding/deleting variant columns, and reordering rows using drag-and-drop.

## Features

- **Add/Delete State Rows:** Dynamically add and remove rows representing different states.
- **Add/Delete Variant Columns:** Dynamically add and remove columns for design variants.
- **Row Reordering:** Reorder state rows using drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Design Insertion:** Optionally insert a design into specific variant columns (not implemented in this version).
